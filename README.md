# Kill the Bugs!

1. You are only allowed to kill one bug at a time.
2. There are 12 bugs. Your task is to kill them with the lowest possible score of 'attempts'. The 'attempts' score counts how many times you kill a bug.
3. The best 'attempts' score you can achieve is 12, which means you kill all the bugs with only one try.
4. This game does not support any violence towards animals. Calm down, this is just a silly game!
